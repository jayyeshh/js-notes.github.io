Scalling: 
1. Buy bigger machines - vertical scaling.
2. Buy more machine - horizontal scaling

horizontal scaling: 
- load balancing required.
- Resilient
    a system is resilient if it continues to carry out its mission in the face of adversity. ( caching )
- Network calls ( RPC )
- Data Inconsistency
- Scale well as user increases.

vertical scaling: 
- Load balancing N/A
- Single Point of failure
- Inter Process Communication
- Consistent
- Hardware limit.
